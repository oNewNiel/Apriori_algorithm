<h1 align="center">Application of Apriori algorithm on grocery store sales</h1>

This project is the result or some part of my undergraduate thesis.
This repo will contain python files used on EDA over a dataset that represents all products sold in a grocery store during a year.

The purpose was to use a Data Mining algorithm that combines all sets of products that were sold in a period and
present which set had a more representative impact.
